## Database structure updater


</div>

### Description

Any true application uses a database, however after deployment, some times you add or modify some fields, and it becomes tiring to adjust the changes manually at clients sites. this is a stripped down version of the application ( there may be some errors due to the stripping down of unneeded funstions ) . Enjoy it without reservations. Vote if you feel like this is something beneficial for you.
 
### More Info
 
This code relies on RDO ( never had the time to change to OLEDB ).

You should have generated the new script of the modified database, and have at least the client database created.

works on MS SQL, No known side effects
